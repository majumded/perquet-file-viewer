## Introduction

Parquet Data Viewer is a lightweight desktop application designed to help users easily view, explore, and export data stored in Apache Parquet files. With a simple and intuitive interface, this tool allows users to:

- Quickly open and browse Parquet files
- View detailed information about file metadata
- Examine individual records in detail
- Export Parquet data to CSV format for broader compatibility

This application is ideal for data analysts, engineers, and anyone who works with data stored in the Parquet file format but requires a simple visualization tool without the need for programming or complex data tools.

- **Application Title**: "Parquet Data Viewer"
- **File Information**: Shows the currently loaded file name
- **Button Controls**:
  - **Select File**: Opens a file dialog to choose a Parquet file
  - **Refresh Data**: Reloads data from the current file
  - **Download**: Exports the current data to CSV format
  - **File Info**: Shows metadata about the currently loaded Parquet file

### Data Table

The central area of the application contains a table view with the following features:

- **Column Headers**: Click to sort data (if supported)
- **Horizontal and Vertical Scrollbars**: For navigating large datasets
- **Adjustable Column Widths**: Automatically sized to fit data

### Status Bar

---

## Basic Operations

### Opening a Parquet File

1. Click the **Select File** button in the header section
2. In the file dialog that appears, navigate to the location of your Parquet file
3. Select the desired .parquet file and click "Open"
4. The application will load and display the data

**Note**: The application remembers the last directory you accessed, making it easier to navigate to commonly used locations.

### Viewing Data

Once a file is loaded, the data table will display the contents with the following features:

- Each row represents a record in the Parquet file
- Each column represents a field in the data
- Column widths automatically adjust to accommodate the data
- Use the scroll bars to navigate through large datasets

### Refreshing Data

If the Parquet file has been updated externally while the application is running:

1. Click the **Refresh Data** button in the header section
2. The application will reload the current file and update the display

### Viewing File Information

To view detailed information about the loaded Parquet file:

1. Click the **File Info** button in the header section
2. A dialog will appear showing:
   - Full file path
   - File size in MB
   - Last modified date and time
   - Verbose mode setting (if defined in config.properties)

---

## Working with Records

### Viewing Record Details

To examine a specific record in detail:

1. Double-click on any row in the data table or select a row and press Enter
2. A "Record Details" window will appear showing:
   - Each field name and its corresponding value
   - Values are displayed with proper formatting and wrapping for readability
3. Use the scrollbar to navigate through all fields if needed
4. Click the **Close** button to return to the main view

### Navigating the Data Table

- Use the **vertical scrollbar** to move through records (rows)
- Use the **horizontal scrollbar** to view additional fields (columns)
- Use keyboard navigation (arrow keys) to move between cells

---

## Data Export

### Exporting to CSV

To export the currently loaded Parquet data to CSV format:

1. Click the **Download** button in the header section
2. The application will:
   - Create a CSV file with the same name as the Parquet file in the same directory
   - Display a progress indicator during the export process
   - Show a confirmation message when the export is complete, including the file path
3. If a file with the same name already exists, you will be prompted to confirm overwriting

**Note**: The exported CSV file will contain all data from the Parquet file with the same structure and field names.

---

## Configuration

### Config.properties File

The application uses a configuration file named `config.properties` to store settings and file paths. This file is automatically created or updated when you:

- Select a Parquet file through the interface
- Change application settings

The configuration file is located in the same directory as the application and contains:

```
[FILE_PATHS]
parquet_file_path = /path/to/your/last/used/file.parquet

[OPTIONS]
verbose = true
```

### Verbose Mode

The "verbose" setting in the config.properties file controls the level of console output:

- **true**: The application will print additional information to the console, including file paths and record counts
- **false**: The application will minimize console output

To change this setting:
1. Locate the config.properties file in the application directory
2. Open it with a text editor
3. Change the verbose value to either "true" or "false"
4. Save the file and restart the application for the changes to take effect

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application fails to start:**
- Ensure Python is properly installed
- Verify that all required packages are installed
- Check console output for specific error messages

**Cannot open Parquet files:**
- Verify that the file has a .parquet extension
- Check that the file is not corrupted or empty
- Ensure you have read permissions for the file

**Data table is empty after loading a file:**
- The Parquet file might be empty
- The file might not be in proper Parquet format
- Check the record count in the status bar

### Error Messages

**"Parquet file not found":**
- The specified file no longer exists at the given location
- The file path in config.properties might be outdated

**"Could not get file information":**
- The file might be locked by another process
- You might not have permission to access the file

**"Failed to update config file":**
- The application directory might be write-protected
- The config.properties file might be locked by another process
